## Packages

### [value_annotation]

A package of annotation classes for [value_class].\
No test code is needed and this package will not be modified except when adding functionality.

### [value_class]

Uses [build_runner] to automatically generate the necessary code for a "Value Class" from a class annotated with `@valueClass`.\
Needs to enrich with tests.

After installation, check the version.

```

### Install dependencies 

```shell

```

### Operation check 

```shell
dart run build_runner build

Please make use of the shared configuration file [build.dart.run.xml].

> **Warning**\

[Breakpoints] allow you to pause program execution at a specific point and examine the state and behavior of the program, which can be very useful.
