### Self review

You should always review your own PR first.

For content changes, make sure that you:

- [ ] Does `dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .` succeed?
- [ ] Does `dart analyze --fatal-infos` succeed?
- [ ] Does `dart test` succeed?
- [ ] Are there any typos?
- [ ] Have you included unnecessary changes?
